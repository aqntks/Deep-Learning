## About iPython Notebooks ##

iPython Notebooks are interactive coding environments embedded in a
webpage. You will be using iPython notebooks in this class. You only
need to write code between the # your code here comment. After writing
your code, you can run the cell by either pressing ``SHIFT''+``ENTER''
or by clicking on ``Run Cell'' (denoted by a play symbol) in the upper
bar of the notebook.

We will often specify ``(â‰ˆ X lines of code)'' in the comments to tell
you about how much code you need to write. It is just a rough estimate,
so donâ€™t feel bad if your code is longer or shorter.

### Exercise 1 Set test to `"Hello World"` in the cell below to print
``Hello World'' and run the two cells below.


+*In[1]:*+
[source, ipython3]
----
# (â‰ˆ 1 line of code)
# test = 
# YOUR CODE STARTS HERE
test = "Hello World"

# YOUR CODE ENDS HERE
----


+*In[2]:*+
[source, ipython3]
----
print ("test: " + test)
----


+*Out[2]:*+
----
test: Hello World
----

*Expected output*: test: Hello World

What you need to remember :

* Run your cells using SHIFT+ENTER (or ``Run cell'')
* Write code in the designated areas using Python 3 only
* Do not modify the code outside of the designated areas

## 1 - Building basic functions with numpy ##

Numpy is the main package for scientific computing in Python. It is
maintained by a large community (www.numpy.org). In this exercise you
will learn several key numpy functions such as `np.exp`, `np.log`, and
`np.reshape`. You will need to know how to use these functions for
future assignments.

### 1.1 - sigmoid function, np.exp() ###

Before using `np.exp()`, you will use `math.exp()` to implement the
sigmoid function. You will then see why `np.exp()` is preferable to
`math.exp()`.

### Exercise 2 - basic_sigmoid Build a function that returns the sigmoid
of a real number x. Use `math.exp(x)` for the exponential function.

*Reminder*: latexmath:[$sigmoid(x) = \frac{1}{1+e^{-x}}$] is sometimes
also known as the logistic function. It is a non-linear function used
not only in Machine Learning (Logistic Regression), but also in Deep
Learning.

To refer to a function belonging to a specific package you could call it
using `package_name.function()`. Run the code below to see an example
with `math.exp()`.

Actually, we rarely use the ``math'' library in deep learning because
the inputs of the functions are real numbers. In deep learning we mostly
use matrices and vectors. This is why numpy is more useful.

### One reason why we use "numpy" instead of "math" in Deep Learning ###

In fact, if $ x = (x_1, x_2, â€¦, x_n)$ is a row vector then `np.exp(x)`
will apply the exponential function to every element of x. The output
will thus be: `np.exp(x) = (e^{x_1}, e^{x_2}, ..., e^{x_n})`

Furthermore, if x is a vector, then a Python operation such as
latexmath:[$s = x + 3$] or latexmath:[$s = \frac{1}{x}$] will output s
as a vector of the same size as x.

Any time you need more info on a numpy function, we encourage you to
look at
https://docs.scipy.org/doc/numpy-1.10.1/reference/generated/numpy.exp.html[the
official documentation].

You can also create a new cell in the notebook and write `np.exp?` (for
example) to get quick access to the documentation.

### Exercise 3 - sigmoid Implement the sigmoid function using numpy.

*Instructions*: x could now be either a real number, a vector, or a
matrix. The data structures we use in numpy to represent these shapes
(vectors, matricesâ€¦) are called numpy arrays. You donâ€™t need to know
more for now.

[latexmath]

\[ \text{For } x \in \mathbb{R}^n \text{,     } sigmoid(x) = sigmoid\begin{pmatrix}
    x_1  \\
    x_2  \\

\end{pmatrix} = \begin{pmatrix}
    \frac{1}{1+e^{-x_1}}  \\

### 1.2 - Sigmoid Gradient

As youâ€™ve seen in lecture, you will need to compute gradients to
optimize loss functions using backpropagation. Letâ€™s code your first
gradient function.

### Exercise 4 - sigmoid_derivative Implement the function
sigmoid_grad() to compute the gradient of the sigmoid function with
respect to its input x. The formula is:

[latexmath]
++++
\[sigmoid\_derivative(x) = \sigma'(x) = \sigma(x) (1 - \sigma(x))\tag{2}\]
++++

You often code this function in two steps: 1. Set s to be the sigmoid of
x. You might find your sigmoid(x) function useful. 2. Compute
latexmath:[$\sigma'(x) = s(1-s)$]


+*In[16]:*+

### 1.3 - Reshaping arrays ###

Two common numpy functions used in deep learning are
https://docs.scipy.org/doc/numpy/reference/generated/numpy.ndarray.shape.html[np.shape]
and
https://docs.scipy.org/doc/numpy/reference/generated/numpy.reshape.html[np.reshape()].
- X.shape is used to get the shape (dimension) of a matrix/vector X. -
X.reshape(â€¦) is used to reshape X into some other dimension.

For example, in computer science, an image is represented by a 3D array
of shape latexmath:[$(length, height, depth = 3)$]. However, when you
read an image as the input of an algorithm you convert it to a vector of
shape latexmath:[$(length*height*3, 1)$]. In other words, you
``unroll'', or reshape, the 3D array into a 1D vector.

### Exercise 5 - image2vector Implement `image2vector()` that takes an
input of shape (length, height, 3) and returns a vector of shape
(length*height*3, 1). For example, if you would like to reshape an array
v of shape (a, b, c) into a vector of shape (a*b,c) you would do:

[source,python]
----
v = v.reshape((v.shape[0] * v.shape[1], v.shape[2])) # v.shape[0] = a ; v.shape[1] = b ; v.shape[2] = c
----

* Please donâ€™t hardcode the dimensions of image as a constant. Instead
look up the quantities you need with `image.shape[0]`, etc.
* You can use v = v.reshape(-1, 1). Just make sure you understand why it
works.

### 1.4 - Normalizing rows

Another common technique we use in Machine Learning and Deep Learning is
to normalize our data. It often leads to a better performance because
gradient descent converges faster after normalization. Here, by
normalization we mean changing x to $ $ (dividing each row vector of x
by its norm).

For example, if

[latexmath]
++++
\[x = \begin{bmatrix}
        0 & 3 & 4 \\
        2 & 6 & 4 \\
\end{bmatrix}\tag{3}\]
++++
then

[latexmath]
++++
\[\| x\| = \text{np.linalg.norm(x, axis=1, keepdims=True)} = \begin{bmatrix}
    5 \\
    \sqrt{56} \\
\end{bmatrix}\tag{4} \]
++++
and

[latexmath]
++++
\[ x\_normalized = \frac{x}{\| x\|} = \begin{bmatrix}
    0 & \frac{3}{5} & \frac{4}{5} \\
    \frac{2}{\sqrt{56}} & \frac{6}{\sqrt{56}} & \frac{4}{\sqrt{56}} \\
\end{bmatrix}\tag{5}\]
++++

Note that you can divide matrices of different sizes and it works fine:
this is called broadcasting and youâ€™re going to learn about it in part
5.

With `keepdims=True` the result will broadcast correctly against the
original x.

`axis=1` means you are going to get the norm in a row-wise manner. If
you need the norm in a column-wise way, you would need to set `axis=0`.

numpy.linalg.norm has another parameter `ord` where we specify the type
of normalization to be done (in the exercise below youâ€™ll do 2-norm). To
get familiar with the types of normalization you can visit
https://numpy.org/doc/stable/reference/generated/numpy.linalg.norm.html[numpy.linalg.norm]

### Exercise 6 - normalize_rows Implement normalizeRows() to normalize
the rows of a matrix. After applying this function to an input matrix x,
each row of x should be a vector of unit length (meaning length 1).

*Note*: Donâ€™t try to use `x /= x_norm`. For the matrix division numpy
must broadcast the x_norm, which is not supported by the operant `/=`


+*In[20]:*+
[source, ipython3]
----
# GRADED FUNCTION: normalize_rows

def normalize_rows(x):
    """

    """

    x = x / x_norm
    # YOUR CODE ENDS HERE

    return x
----


+*In[21]:*+
[source, ipython3]
----
x = np.array([[0, 3, 4],
              [1, 6, 4]])
print("normalizeRows(x) = " + str(normalize_rows(x)))

+*Out[21]:*+

 [0.13736056 0.82416338 0.54944226]]
[92m All tests passed.
----

*Note*: In normalize_rows(), you can try to print the shapes of x_norm
and x, and then rerun the assessment. Youâ€™ll find out that they have
different shapes. This is normal given that x_norm takes the norm of
each row of x. So x_norm has the same number of rows but only 1 column.
So how did it work when you divided x by x_norm? This is called
broadcasting and weâ€™ll talk about it now!

### Exercise 7 - softmax Implement a softmax function using numpy. You
can think of softmax as a normalizing function used when your algorithm
needs to classify two or more classes. You will learn more about softmax
in the second course of this specialization.

*Instructions*: -
latexmath:[$\text{for } x \in \mathbb{R}^{1\times n} \text{,     }$]

* latexmath:[$\text{for a matrix } x \in \mathbb{R}^{m \times n} \text{,  $x_{ij}$ maps to the element in the $i^{th}$ row and $j^{th}$ column of $x$, thus we have: }$]

*Notes:* Note that later in the course, youâ€™ll see ``m'' used to
represent the ``number of training examples'', and each training example
is in its own column of the matrix. Also, each feature will be in its
own row (each row has data for the same feature). +
Softmax should be performed for all features of each training example,
so softmax would be performed on the columns (once we switch to that
representation later in this course).

However, in this coding practice, weâ€™re just focusing on getting
familiar with Python, so weâ€™re using the common math notation
latexmath:[$m \times n$] +
where latexmath:[$m$] is the number of rows and latexmath:[$n$] is the
number of columns.

== Notes

* If you print the shapes of x_exp, x_sum and s above and rerun the
assessment cell, you will see that x_sum is of shape (2,1) while x_exp
and s are of shape (2,5). *x_exp/x_sum* works due to python
broadcasting.

Congratulations! You now have a pretty good understanding of python
numpy and have implemented a few useful functions that you will be using
in deep learning.

What you need to remember:

* np.exp(x) works for any np.array x and applies the exponential
function to every coordinate
* the sigmoid function and its gradient
* image2vector is commonly used in deep learning
* np.reshape is widely used. In the future, youâ€™ll see that keeping your
matrix/vector dimensions straight will go toward eliminating a lot of
bugs.
* numpy has efficient built-in functions
* broadcasting is extremely useful

## 2 - Vectorization

In deep learning, you deal with very large datasets. Hence, a
non-computationally-optimal function can become a huge bottleneck in
your algorithm and can result in a model that takes ages to run. To make
sure that your code is computationally efficient, you will use
vectorization. For example, try to tell the difference between the
following implementations of the dot/outer/elementwise product.


+*In[32]:*+

x1 = [9, 2, 5, 0, 0, 7, 5, 0, 0, 0, 9, 2, 5, 0, 0]

    dot += x1[i] * x2[i]
toc = time.process_time()
print ("dot = " + str(dot) + "\n ----- Computation time = " + str(1000 * (toc - tic)) + "ms")

### CLASSIC OUTER PRODUCT IMPLEMENTATION ###

As you may have noticed, the vectorized implementation is much cleaner
and more efficient. For bigger vectors/matrices, the differences in
running time become even bigger.

*Note* that `np.dot()` performs a matrix-matrix or matrix-vector
multiplication. This is different from `np.multiply()` and the `*`
operator (which is equivalent to `.*` in Matlab/Octave), which performs
an element-wise multiplication.

### 2.1 Implement the L1 and L2 loss functions

### Exercise 8 - L1 Implement the numpy vectorized version of the L1
loss. You may find the function abs(x) (absolute value of x) useful.

*Reminder*: - The loss is used to evaluate the performance of your
model. The bigger your loss is, the more different your predictions ($
latexmath:[$) are from the true values ($]y$). In deep learning, you use
optimization algorithms like Gradient Descent to train your model and to
minimize the cost. - L1 loss is defined as:

[latexmath]
++++
\[\begin{align*} & L_1(\hat{y}, y) = \sum_{i=0}^{m-1}|y^{(i)} - \hat{y}^{(i)}| \end{align*}\tag{6}\]
++++

    y -- vector of size m (true labels)

    """
    
    #(â‰ˆ 1 line of code)
    # loss =

    loss = np.sum(abs(y - yhat))

y = np.array([1, 0, 0, 1, 1])

L1 = 1.1

### Exercise 9 - L2 Implement the numpy vectorized version of the L2
loss. There are several way of implementing the L2 loss but you may find
the function np.dot() useful. As a reminder, if
latexmath:[$x = [x_1, x_2, ..., x_n]$], then `np.dot(x,x)` =
latexmath:[$\sum_{j=0}^n x_j^{2}$].

* L2 loss is defined as
+
[latexmath]
++++
\[\begin{align*} & L_2(\hat{y},y) = \sum_{i=0}^{m-1}(y^{(i)} - \hat{y}^{(i)})^2 \end{align*}\tag{7}\]

Congratulations on completing this assignment. We hope that this little
warm-up exercise helps you in the future assignments, which will be more
exciting and interesting!

What to remember:

* Vectorization is very important in deep learning. It provides
computational efficiency and clarity.
* You have reviewed the L1 and L2 loss.
* You are familiar with many numpy functions such as np.sum, np.dot,
np.multiply, np.maximum, etcâ€¦
